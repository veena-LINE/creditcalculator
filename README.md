# creditcalculator
A simple Credit Calculator that calculates Annuity/Differentiated payment values.

Use the Credit Calculator to determine your fixed/variable monthly payments for a simple loan.

You will also be able to find out the term/principal depending on how much you are able to afford monthly.

At the end, you will also get to know the overpayment.
